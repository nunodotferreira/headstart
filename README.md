# [Headstart](website-url), an automated front-end setup

> Headstart is an all-in-one task runner that frees front-end developers of the little worries that come along with modern web development. If you ever wanted to use tools like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), but found the configuration too troublesome, you will probably like this pre-configured setup better.
